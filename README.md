# OneShelf
OneShelf is a lightweight, offline-first web app that lets users save anything they find online—songs, videos, images, and movies—by simply pasting a URL. It automatically turns links into clean preview cards with thumbnails and metadata, storing everything locally in the browser with no accounts, no cloud, and no tracking.

### inspired by mymind but with features to store movies like letterboxd or songs like spotify
